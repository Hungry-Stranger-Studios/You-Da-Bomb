# You Play as Da Bomb!
Like any sensible bomb, you dont want to explode. One day you woke up not in your usual comfy bunker but in a plane flying over a testing zone. All your days of relaxing are over, its time to defuse yourself. 

# The Goal
To defuse yourself, you must complete a series of periodically spawning puzzles as well as pesky constant puzzles you just cant seem to get rid of. Ignoring puzzles will stress you out and we all know what happens when a bomb gets too stressed...
